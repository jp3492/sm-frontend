        <p>
          Our goal is to create a sustainable and productive workplace as well
          as service to our users. Therefore we intend to have a good balance
          between utility- and value based pricing. We believe in fair pricing
          and transparent use of data.
          <br />
          <br />
          By restricting sharing capabilities to a paid account, we intend to
          ensure higher quality of our community. Free social media platforms
          tend to run into issues the bigger the user base gets. We hope to
          prevent some of these issues while attracting people with professional
          purpose.
