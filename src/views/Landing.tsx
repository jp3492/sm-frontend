            Copy a video link from YouTube, Twitch, Dropbox and others.
            <br />! No video is saved on this platform. We only save a reference
            to videos via url and interact with the sources provided player!

        </p>
        <p>

            Go to your Viden dashboard and save the link into your directory.

            You can create folders and organize your videos, playlists and
            sequences. We provide an easy to use, drag & drop UI with a standard
            folder system.

            Creating playlists is as easy as dropping videos onto the playlist
            panel. Once saved you can share (if enabled) your playlists as well
            as videos via link online.

            One of the main functionalities of Viden is to disect and tag
            sequences. You can set a start and stop tag on every video as well
            as a comment. Sequences can be shared and used in playlists, just
            like any video.
